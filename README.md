# Getting Started with Create React App
Note the instructions from line 75 in this README file are project specific , these initial notes lines 1 to 74 are generic to React.js

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# Project Specific Implementation steps :

Create a new React project:
text
npx create-react-app react-with-material-ui
cd react-with-material-ui

Install Material UI and its dependencies:
text
npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled

Create a components folder in your src directory.
Create a new component file (e.g. form.js) in the components folder.
Import the Material UI components you want to use at the top of your component file:
jsx
import { TextField, Button, Typography, Box } from '@mui/material';
import React, { useState } from 'react';

Create your component function and set up any necessary state:
jsx
export default function FormData() {
  const [email, setEmail] = useState('');
  const [password, setPassword] = useState('');
  
  // Component logic here
}

Use Material UI components in your JSX return statement:
jsx
return (
  <Box>
    <Typography>Your Form</Typography>
    <TextField 
      label="Email"
      value={email}
      onChange={(e) => setEmail(e.target.value)}
    />
    <Button variant="contained">Submit</Button>
  </Box>
);

Import and use your new component in App.js or other parts of your application.
Run your React application:
text
npm start

View your application with Material UI components at http://localhost:3000
Remember to customize the Material UI components and add any additional logic as needed for your specific application.
